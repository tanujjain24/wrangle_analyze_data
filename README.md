# Wrangle and Analyze Data

## Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Thus we perform data wrangling by gathering data from a variety of sources and formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it.

In this project, we will be wrangling, analyzing and visualizing the dataset which is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017. More on this soon.
